# Dunkman ⛹️‍♂️

A basketball version of the classic [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) game. A random basketball themed word(s) is generated at the start of the game. The player has 7 shots to spell out the correct word. If the correct word is not spelled out in full by the 7th shot then the player is dunked on!

Game is still a work in progress . . .
